# pi-basic-programs-
Here, we have few python programs which help to interface various sensors and actuators with Raspberry pi
In this repository, I have curated and created multiple python programs for Raspberry pi, for pi begineers. Topics which are covered in 
there programs are:
1) LED interfacing and blinking
2) LED blink control using switch
3) 16x2 LCD interfacing with Raspberry pi
4) LED control using PWM
5) Interfacing MCP3008 ADC with Raspberry pi
6) Interfacing PIR sensors with Raspberry pi
7) pi receiving data serially
8) Multiple programs for RTC interfacing with Raspberry pi
9) Interfacing Ultrasonic sensor with Raspberry pi
10) Multiple programs to access Twitter, send tweet and search tweet using Raspberry pi 
11) Server side Socket programming

Hope these basic programs would help any begineer of python and Raspberry pi to a decent level to develop their own interesting projects!
